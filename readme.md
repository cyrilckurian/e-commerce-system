   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Define the following variables in the `.env` file:
     ```
     PORT=3000
     MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
